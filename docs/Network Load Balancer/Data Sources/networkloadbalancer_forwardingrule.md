# ionoscloud_networkloadbalancer_forwardingrule

The network load balancer forwarding rule data source can be used to search for and return existing network forwarding rules.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ionoscloud_networkloadbalancer_forwardingrule" "example" {
  datacenter_id = ionoscloud_datacenter.example.id
  networkloadbalancer_id  = ionoscloud_networkloadbalancer.example.id
  name			= "example_"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `datacenter_id` - (Required) Datacenter's UUID.
* `networkloadbalancer_id` - (Required) Network Load Balancer's UUID.
* `name` - (Optional) Name of an existing network load balancer forwarding rule that you want to search for.
* `id` - (Optional) ID of the network load balancer forwarding rule you want to search for.

Both `datacenter_id` and `networkloadbalancer_id` and either `name` or `id` must be provided. If none, or both of `name` and `id` are provided, the datasource will return an error.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are returned by the datasource:

* `id` - The id of that Network Load Balancer forwarding rule.
* `name` - The name of that Network Load Balancer forwarding rule.
* `algorithm` - Algorithm for the balancing.
* `protocol` - Protocol of the balancing.
* `listener_ip` - Listening IP. (inbound)
* `listener_port` - Listening port number. (inbound) (range: 1 to 65535)
* `health_check` - Health check attributes for Network Load Balancer forwarding rule.
    * `client_timeout` - ClientTimeout is expressed in milliseconds. This inactivity timeout applies when the client is expected to acknowledge or send data. If unset the default of 50 seconds will be used.
    * `connect_timeout` - It specifies the maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for a connection attempt to a target VM to succeed. If unset, the default of 5 seconds will be used.
    * `target_timeout` - TargetTimeout specifies the maximum inactivity time (in milliseconds) on the target VM side. If unset, the default of 50 seconds will be used.
    * `retries` - Retries specifies the number of retries to perform on a target VM after a connection failure. If unset, the default value of 3 will be used.
* `targets` - Array of items in that collection.
    * `ip` -  IP of a balanced target VM.
    * `port` - Port of the balanced target service. (range: 1 to 65535).
    * `weight` - Weight parameter is used to adjust the target VM's weight relative to other target VMs.
    * `health_check` -  Health check attributes for Network Load Balancer forwarding rule target.
        * `check` - Check specifies whether the target VM's health is checked.
        * `check_interval` - CheckInterval determines the duration (in milliseconds) between consecutive health checks. If unspecified a default of 2000 ms is used.
        * `maintenance` - Maintenance specifies if a target VM should be marked as down, even if it is not.
