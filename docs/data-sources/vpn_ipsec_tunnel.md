# ionoscloud_vpn_ipsec_tunnel

The **VPN IPSec Gateway Tunnel data source** can be used to search for and return an existing IPSec Gateway Tunnel.
You can provide a string for the name parameter which will be compared with provisioned IPSec Gateway Tunnels.
If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned.
When this happens, please refine your search string so that it is specific enough to return only one result.

## Example Usage

### By ID

```hcl
data "ionoscloud_vpn_ipsec_tunnel" "example" {
  id = <tunnel_id>
  gateway_id = <gateway_id>
  location = <gateway_location>
}
```

### By Name

Needs to have the resource be previously created, or a depends_on clause to ensure that the resource is created before
this data source is called.

```hcl
data "ionoscloud_vpn_ipsec_gateway" "example" {
  name     = "ipsec-tunnel"
  gateway_id = <gateway_id>
  location = <gateway_location>
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `id` - (Optional) ID of an existing IPSec Gateway Tunnel that you want to search for.
* `name` - (Optional) Name of an existing IPSec Gateway Tunnel that you want to search for.
* `gateway_id` - (Required) The ID of the IPSec Gateway that the tunnel belongs to.
* `location` - (Required) The location of the IPSec Gateway Tunnel.

## Attributes reference
