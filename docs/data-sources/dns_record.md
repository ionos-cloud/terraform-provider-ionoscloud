# ionoscloud_dns_record

The **DNS Record** can be used to search for and return an existing DNS Record.
If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned.
When this happens, please refine your search and make sure that your resources have unique names.

## Example Usage

### By ID

```hcl
data "ionoscloud_dns_record" "example" {
  id = <record_id>
  zone_id = <zone_id>
}
```

### By name
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_dns_record" "example" {
  name = "recordexample"
  zone_id = <zone_id>
}
```

### By name with partial match
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_dns_record" "example" {
  name = "record"
  partial_match = true
  zone_id = <zone_id>
}
```
