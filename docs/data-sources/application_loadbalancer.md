# ionoscloud_application_loadbalancer

The **Application Load Balancer data source** can be used to search for and return an existing Application Load Balancer.
You can provide a string for the name parameter which will be compared with provisioned Application Load Balancers.
If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned.
When this happens, please refine your search and make sure that your resources have unique names.

## Example Usage

### By Id
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_application_loadbalancer" "example" {
  datacenter_id = ionoscloud_datacenter.example.id
  id            = <alb_id>
}
```

### By Name
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_application_loadbalancer" "example" {
  datacenter_id = ionoscloud_datacenter.example.id
  name          = "ALB name"
}
```

### By Name with Partial Match
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_application_loadbalancer" "example" {
  datacenter_id = ionoscloud_datacenter.example.id
  name          = "name"
  partial_match = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `datacenter_id` - (Required) Datacenter's UUID.
* `id` - (Optional) ID of the application load balancer you want to search for.
* `name` - (Optional) Name of an existing application load balancer that you want to search for. Search by name is case-insensitive. The whole resource name is required if `partial_match` parameter is not set to true.
* `partial_match` - (Optional) Whether partial matching is allowed or not when using name argument. Default value is false.

`datacenter_id` and either `name` or `id` must be provided. If none, or both of `name` and `id` are provided, the datasource will return an error.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are returned by the datasource:

* `id` - Id of the application load balancer.
- `name` - The name of the Application Load Balancer.
- `listener_lan` - ID of the listening (inbound) LAN.
- `ips` - Collection of the Application Load Balancer IP addresses. (Inbound and outbound) IPs of the listenerLan are customer-reserved public IPs for the public Load Balancers, and private IPs for the private Load Balancers.
- `target_lan` - ID of the balanced private target LAN (outbound).
- `lb_private_ips` - Collection of private IP addresses with the subnet mask of the Application Load Balancer. IPs must contain valid a subnet mask. If no IP is provided, the system will generate an IP with /24 subnet.
- `flowlog` - Only 1 flow log can be configured. Only the name field can change as part of an update. Flow logs holistically capture network information such as source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, number of packets, amount of bytes, the start and end time of the recording, and the type of protocol â€“ and log the extent to which your instances are being accessed.
    - `action` - Specifies the action to be taken when the rule is matched. Possible values: ACCEPTED, REJECTED, ALL. Immutable, forces re-creation.
    - `bucket` - Specifies the S3 IONOS bucket where the flow log data will be stored. The bucket must exist. Immutable, forces re-creation.
    - `direction` - Specifies the traffic direction pattern. Valid values: INGRESS, EGRESS, BIDIRECTIONAL. Immutable, forces re-creation.
    - `name` - Specifies the name of the flow log.
