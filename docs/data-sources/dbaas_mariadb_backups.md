# ionoscloud\_mariadb_backups

The **DBaaS MariaDB Backups data source** can be used to search for and return existing DBaaS MariaDB Backups for a specific cluster.

## Example Usage

### Get all backups for a specific cluster
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_mariadb_backups" "example" { 
    cluster_id = <cluster_id>
    location   = "de/txl"
}
```

### Get a specific backup
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_mariadb_backups" "example" {
    backup_id = <backup_id>
    location   = "de/txl"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `cluster_id` - (Optional)[string] The unique ID of the cluster.
* `backup_id` - (Optional)[string] The unique ID of the backup.
* `location`- (Optional)[string] The location of the cluster. Different service endpoints are used based on location, possible options are: "de/fra", "de/txl", "es/vit", "fr/par", "gb/lhr", "us/ewr", "us/las", "us/mci". If not set, the endpoint will be the one corresponding to "de/txl".

> **⚠ WARNING:** `Location` attribute will become required in the future.
