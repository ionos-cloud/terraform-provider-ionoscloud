# ionoscloud\_firewall

The **Firewall data source** can be used to search for and return an existing FirewallRules. 
You can provide a string for either id or name parameters which will be compared with provisioned Firewall Rules.
If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned.
When this happens, please refine your search and make sure that your resources have unique names.

## Example Usage

### By ID
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_firewall" "example" {
  datacenter_id = <datacenter_id>
  server_id     = <server_id>
  nic_id        = <nic_id>
  id            = <firewall_id>
}
```

### By Name
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_firewall" "example" {
  datacenter_id   = <datacenter_id>
  server_id       = <server_id>
  nic_id          = <nic_id>
  name            = "Firewall Rule Example"
}
```

### By Name with Partial Match
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_firewall" "example" {
  datacenter_id   = <datacenter_id>
  server_id       = <server_id>
  nic_id          = <nic_id>
  name            = "Firewall"
  partial_match   = true
}
```
