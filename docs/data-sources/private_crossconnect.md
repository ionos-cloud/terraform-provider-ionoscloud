# ionoscloud\_private_crossconnect

The **Private Crossconnect data source** can be used to search for and return existing private crossconnects.
If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned.
When this happens, please refine your search and make sure that your resources have unique names.

## Example Usage

### By ID
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_private_crossconnect" "example" {
  id       = <private_crossconnect_id>
}
```

### By Name
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_private_crossconnect" "example" {
  name     = "PCC Example"
}
```

### By Name with Partial Match
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_private_crossconnect" "example" {
  name          = "Example"
  partial_match = true
}
```
