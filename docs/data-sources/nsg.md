# ionoscloud_nsg

The **NSG Data source** can be used to search for and return an existing security group.
If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned.
When this happens, please refine your search string so that it is specific enough to return only one result.

## Example Usage

### By ID
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_nsg" "example" {
  datacenter_id  = ionoscloud_datacenter.example.id
  id             = nsg_id
}
```

### By Name
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_nsg" "example" {
  datacenter_id  = ionoscloud_datacenter.example.id
  name     = "NSG Example"
}
```

* `id` - (Optional) Id of an existing Network Security Group that you want to search for.
* `name` - (Optional) Name of an existing Network Security Group that you want to search for.

Either `name`, or `id` must be provided. If none, the datasource will return an error.

## Attributes Reference

* `datacenter_id` - UUID of the Virtual Data Center
* `id` - UUID of the Network Security Group
