data "ionoscloud_nfs_share" "example" {
  location = <location>
  cluster_id = <cluster-id>
  name = <partial-name>
  partial_match = true
}

output "share_test_output" {
    value = format("share %s quota %sMiB path '%s'",
        data.ionoscloud_nfs_share.example.name,
        data.ionoscloud_nfs_share.example.quota,

## Attributes Reference

- `id` - The ID of the Network File Storage share.
- `name` - The name of the Network File Storage share.
- `location` - The location where the Network File Storage share is located.
- `cluster_id` - The ID of the Network File Storage cluster.
- `nfs_path` - Path to the NFS export. The NFS path is the path to the directory being exported.
- `quota` - The quota in MiB for the export. The quota can restrict the amount of data that can be stored within the export. The quota can be disabled using `0`.

    - `ip_networks` - The allowed host or network to which the export is being shared. The IP address can be either IPv4 or IPv6 and has to be given with CIDR notation.
    - `hosts` - A singular host allowed to connect to the share. The host can be specified as IP address and can be either IPv4 or IPv6.
    - `nfs` - The NFS configuration for the client group. Each NFS configuration supports the following:
        - `squash` - The squash mode for the export. The squash mode can be: none - No squash mode. no mapping, root-anonymous - Map root user to anonymous uid, all-anonymous - Map all users to anonymous uid.
