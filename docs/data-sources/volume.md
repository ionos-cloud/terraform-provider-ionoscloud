# ionoscloud\_volume

The volume data source can be used to search for and return existing volumes.
If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned.
When this happens, please refine your search string so that it is specific enough to return only one result.

## Example Usage

### By ID
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_volume" "example" {
  datacenter_id = <datacenter_id>
  id			= <volume_id>
}
```

### By Name
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_volume" "example" {
  datacenter_id = <datacenter_id>
  name			= "Volume Example"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Optional) Name of an existing volume that you want to search for.
* `id` - (Optional) ID of the volume you want to search for.

Either `volume` or `id` must be provided. If none, or both are provided, the datasource will return an error.

* `id` - The id of the volume.
* `name` - The name of the volume.
* `disk_type` - The volume type: HDD or SSD.
* `bus` - The bus type of the volume: VIRTIO or IDE.
* `size` -  The size of the volume in GB.
* `ssh_key_path` -  List of paths to files containing a public SSH key that will be injected into IonosCloud provided Linux images. Also accepts ssh keys directly.
