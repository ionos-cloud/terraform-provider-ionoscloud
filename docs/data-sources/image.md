# ionoscloud\_image

The **Image data source** can be used to search for and return an existing image which can then be used to provision a server.  
If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned. 
When this happens, please refine your search string so that it is specific enough to return only one result.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ionoscloud_image" "example" {
  name        = "ubuntu"
  type        = "CDROM"
  location    = "de/fkb"
  cloud_init  = "NONE"
}
```

## Argument Reference

 * `name` - (Required) Name of an existing image that you want to search for.
 * `location` - (Optional) Id of the existing image's location.
 * `type` - (Optional) The image type, HDD or CD-ROM.
