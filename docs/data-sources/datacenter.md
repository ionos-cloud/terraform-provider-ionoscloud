# ionoscloud\_datacenter

The **Datacenter data source** can be used to search for and return an existing Virtual Data Center.
You can provide a string for the name and location parameters which will be compared with provisioned Virtual Data Centers.
If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned.
When this happens, please refine your search and make sure that your resources have unique names.


## Example Usage

### By ID 
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_datacenter" "example" {
  id       = <datacenter_id>
}
```

### By Name & Location
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_datacenter" "example" {
  name     = "Datacenter Example"
  location = "us/las"
}
```

### By Name & Location with Partial Match
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_datacenter" "example" {
  name          = "Datacenter"
  location      = "us/las"
  partial_match = true
}
```
