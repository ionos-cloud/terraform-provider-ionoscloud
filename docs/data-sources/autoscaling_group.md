# ionoscloud\_autoscaling_group

The autoscaling group data source can be used to search for and return an existing Autoscaling Group. You can provide a string for the name or id parameters which will be compared with provisioned Autoscaling Groups. If a single match is found, it will be returned.

## Example Usage

### By Id
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_autoscaling_group" "autoscaling_group" {
  id = <autoscaling_group_uuid>
}
```

### By Name
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_autoscaling_group" "autoscaling_group" {
  name = "test_ds"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `id` - (Optional) Id of an existing Autoscaling Group that you want to search for.
* `name` - (Optional) Name of an existing Autoscaling Group that you want to search for.

Either `name` or `id` must be provided. If none or both are provided, the datasource will return an error.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are returned by the datasource:


* `id` - UUID of the Autoscaling Group.
* `name` - The name of the Autoscaling Group.
* `datacenter` - VMs for this Autoscaling Group will be created in this Virtual Datacenter. Please note, that it has to have the same `location` as the `template`.
    * `href` - Absolute URL to the resource's representation
    * `type` - Type of resource
    * `id` - Unique identifier for the resource
* `location` - Location of the datacenter. This location is the same as the one from the selected template.
* `max_replica_count` - Maximum replica count value for `targetReplicaCount`. Will be enforced for both automatic and manual changes.
* `min_replica_count` - Minimum replica count value for `targetReplicaCount`. Will be enforced for both automatic and manual changes.
* `policy` - Specifies the behavior of this Autoscaling Group. A policy consists of Triggers and Actions, whereby an Action is some kind of automated behavior, and a Trigger is defined by the circumstances under which the Action is triggered. Currently, two separate Actions, namely Scaling In and Out are supported, triggered through Thresholds defined on a given Metric.
    * `metric` - The Metric that should trigger Scaling Actions. The values of the Metric are checked in fixed intervals.
    * `range` - Defines the range of time from which samples will be aggregated. Default is 120s.
      *Note that when you set it to values like 5m the API will automatically transform it in PT5M, so the plan will show you a diff in state that should be ignored.*
    * `scale_in_action` - Specifies the Action to take when the `scaleInThreshold`
        * `amount` - When `amountType == ABSOLUTE`, this is the number of VMs added or removed in one step. When `amountType == PERCENTAGE`, this is a percentage value, which will be applied to the Autoscaling Group's current `targetReplicaCount` in order to derive the number of VMs that will be added or removed in one step. There will always be at least one VM added or removed.
        * `amount_type` - The type for the given amount. Possible values are: [ABSOLUTE, PERCENTAGE].
        * `cooldown_period` - Minimum time to pass after this Scaling Action has started, until the next Scaling Action will be started. Additionally, if a Scaling Action is currently in progress, no second Scaling Action will be started for the same Autoscaling Group. Instead, the Metric will be re-evaluated after the current Scaling Action completed (either successful or with failures).
          *Note that when you set it to values like 5m the API will automatically transform it in PT5M, so the plan will show you a diff in state that should be ignored.*
    * `scale_in_threshold` - A lower threshold on the value of `metric`. Will be used with `less than` (<) operator. Exceeding this will start a Scale-In Action as specified by the `scaleInAction` property. The value must have a higher minimum delta to the `scaleOutThreshold` depending on the `metric` to avoid competitive actions at the same time.
    * `scale_out_action` - Specifies the action to take when the `scaleOutThreshold` is exceeded. Hereby, scaling out is always about adding new VMs to this autoscaling group
        * `amount` - When `amountType == ABSOLUTE`, this is the number of VMs added or removed in one step. When `amountType == PERCENTAGE`, this is a percentage value, which will be applied to the Autoscaling Group's current `targetReplicaCount` in order to derive the number of VMs that will be added or removed in one step. There will always be at least one VM added or removed.
        * `amount_type` - The type for the given amount. Possible values are: [ABSOLUTE, PERCENTAGE].
        * `cooldown_period` - Minimum time to pass after this Scaling Action has started, until the next Scaling Action will be started. Additionally, if a Scaling Action is currently in progress, no second Scaling Action will be started for the same Autoscaling Group. Instead, the Metric will be re-evaluated after the current Scaling Action completed (either successful or with failures).
          *Note that when you set it to values like 5m the API will automatically transform it in PT5M, so the plan will show you a diff in state that should be ignored.*
    * `scale_out_threshold` - The upper threshold for the value of the `metric`. Used with the `greater than` (>) operator. A scale-out action is triggered when this value is exceeded, specified by the `scaleOutAction` property. The value must have a lower minimum delta to the `scaleInThreshold`, depending on the metric, to avoid competing for actions simultaneously. If `properties.policy.unit=TOTAL`, a value >= 40 must be chosen.
    * `unit` - Specifies the Action to take when the `scaleInThreshold` is exceeded. Hereby, scaling in is always about removing VMs that are currently associated with this Autoscaling Group.
* `template` - VMs for this Autoscaling Group will be created using this Template.
    * `href` - Absolute URL to the resource's representation
    * `type` - Type of resource
    * `id` - Unique identifier for the resource
