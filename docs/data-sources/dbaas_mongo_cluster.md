# ionoscloud\_mongo_cluster

The **DbaaS Mongo Cluster data source** can be used to search for and return an existing DbaaS MongoDB Cluster.
If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned.
When this happens, please refine your search string so that it is specific enough to return only one result.

## Example Usage

### By ID
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_mongo_cluster" "example" {
  id	= <cluster_id>
}
```
### By display_name

```hcl
data "ionoscloud_mongo_cluster" "example" {
  display_name	= <display_name>
}
```

* `display_name` - (Optional) Display Name of an existing cluster that you want to search for.
* `id` - (Optional) ID of the cluster you want to search for.

Either `display_name` or `id` must be provided. If none, or both are provided, the datasource will return an error.

## Attributes Reference
