# ionoscloud\_pg_cluster

The **DbaaS Postgres Cluster data source** can be used to search for and return an existing DbaaS Postgres Cluster.
If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned.
When this happens, please refine your search string so that it is specific enough to return only one result.

## Example Usage

### By ID 
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_pg_cluster" "example" {
  id	= <cluster_id>
}
```

### By Name

```hcl
data "ionoscloud_pg_cluster" "example" {
  display_name	= "PostgreSQL_cluster"
}
```
