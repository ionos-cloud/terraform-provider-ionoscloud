# ionoscloud_networkloadbalancer

The **Network Load Balancer data source** can be used to search for and return existing network load balancers.
If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned.
When this happens, please refine your search string so that it is specific enough to return only one result.

## Example Usage

### By ID
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_networkloadbalancer" "example" {
  datacenter_id = ionoscloud_datacenter.example.id
  id            = <networkloadbalancer_id>
}
```

### By Name
```hcl
data "ionoscloud_networkloadbalancer" "example" {
  datacenter_id = ionoscloud_datacenter.example.id
  name          = "Network Load Balancer Name"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `datacenter_id` - (Required) Datacenter's UUID.
* `name` - (Optional) Name of an existing network load balancer that you want to search for.
* `id` - (Optional) ID of the network load balancer you want to search for.

`datacenter_id` and either `name` or `id` must be provided. If none, or both of `name` and `id` are provided, the datasource will return an error.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are returned by the datasource:

* `id` - Id of that Network Load Balancer
* `name`- Name of that Network Load Balancer
* `listener_lan` - Id of the listening LAN. (inbound)
* `target_lan` - Id of the balanced private target LAN. (outbound)
* `ips` - Collection of IP addresses of the Network Load Balancer. (inbound and outbound) IP of the listenerLan must be a customer reserved IP for the public load balancer and private IP for the private load balancer.
* `lb_private_ips` - Collection of private IP addresses with subnet mask of the Network Load Balancer. IPs must contain valid subnet mask. If user will not provide any IP then the system will generate one IP with /24 subnet.
* `flowlog` - Only 1 flow log can be configured. Only the name field can change as part of an update. Flow logs holistically capture network information such as source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, number of packets, amount of bytes, the start and end time of the recording, and the type of protocol â€“ and log the extent to which your instances are being accessed.
  - `action` - Specifies the action to be taken when the rule is matched. Possible values: ACCEPTED, REJECTED, ALL. Immutable, forces re-creation.
  - `bucket` - Specifies the S3 IONOS bucket where the flow log data will be stored. The bucket must exist. Immutable, forces re-creation.
  - `direction` - Specifies the traffic direction pattern. Valid values: INGRESS, EGRESS, BIDIRECTIONAL. Immutable, forces re-creation.
  - `name` - Specifies the name of the flow log.
