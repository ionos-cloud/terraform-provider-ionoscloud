## Example Usage

```hcl

resource "ionoscloud_cdn_distribution" "example" {
  domain         = "example.com"
  certificate_id = ionoscloud_certificate.cert.id
  routing_rules {
    scheme = "https"
    prefix = "/api"
    upstream {
      host                = "server.example.com"
      caching             = true
      waf                 = true
      rate_limit_class    = "R500"
      geo_restrictions {
        allow_list = [ "CN", "RU"]
      }
    }
  }
  routing_rules {
    scheme = "http/https"
    prefix = "/api2"
    upstream {
      host                = "server2.example.com"
      caching             = false
      waf                 = false
      rate_limit_class    = "R10"
      geo_restrictions {
        block_list = [ "CN", "RU"]
      }
    }
  }
}

#optionally you can add a certificate to the distribution
resource "ionoscloud_certificate" "cert" {
  name = "add_name_here"
  certificate = "${file("path_to_cert")}"
  certificate_chain = "${file("path_to_cert_chain")}"
  private_key = "${file("path_to_private_key")}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `domain` - (Required)[string] The domain of the distribution.
- `certificate_id` - (Required)[string] The ID of the certificate to use for the distribution. You can create certificates with the [certificate](certificate.md) resource.
- `routing_rules` - (Required)[list] The routing rules for the distribution.
    - `scheme` - (Required)[string] The scheme of the routing rule.
