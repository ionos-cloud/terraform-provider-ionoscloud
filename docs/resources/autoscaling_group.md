## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `max_replica_count` - (Required)[int] The maximum value for the number of replicas on a VM Auto Scaling Group. Must be >= 0 and <= 200. Will be enforced for both automatic and manual changes.
- `min_replica_count` - (Required)[int] The minimum value for the number of replicas on a VM Auto Scaling Group. Must be >= 0 and <= 200. Will be enforced for both automatic and manual changes.
- `target_replica_count` - (Optional)[int] The target number of VMs in this Group. Depending on the scaling policy, this number will be adjusted automatically. VMs will be created or destroyed automatically in order to adjust the actual number of VMs to this number. If targetReplicaCount is given in the request body then it must be >= minReplicaCount and <= maxReplicaCount.
- `name` - (Required)[string] User-defined name for the Autoscaling Group.
- `policy` - (Required)[List] Specifies the behavior of this Autoscaling Group. A policy consists of Triggers and Actions, whereby an Action is some kind of automated behavior, and a Trigger is defined by the circumstances under which the Action is triggered. Currently, two separate Actions, namely Scaling In and Out are supported, triggered through Thresholds defined on a given Metric.
    - `metric` - (Required)[string] The Metric that should trigger the scaling actions. Metric values are checked at fixed intervals. Possible values: `INSTANCE_CPU_UTILIZATION_AVERAGE`, `INSTANCE_NETWORK_IN_BYTES`, `INSTANCE_NETWORK_IN_PACKETS`, `INSTANCE_NETWORK_OUT_BYTES`, `INSTANCE_NETWORK_OUT_PACKETS`
    - `range` - (Optional)[string] Defines the time range, for which the samples will be aggregated. Default is 120s. *Note that when you set it to values like 5m the API will automatically transform it in PT5M, so the plan will show you a diff in state that should be ignored.*
    - `scale_in_action` - (Required)[list] Specifies the action to take when the `scaleInThreshold` is exceeded. Hereby, scaling in is always about removing VMs that are currently associated with this autoscaling group. Default termination policy is OLDEST_SERVER_FIRST.
        - `amount` - (Required)[int] When `amountType == ABSOLUTE`, this is the number of VMs removed in one step. When `amountType == PERCENTAGE`, this is a percentage value, which will be applied to the autoscaling group's current `targetReplicaCount` in order to derive the number of VMs that will be removed in one step. There will always be at least one VM removed. For SCALE_IN operation new volumes are NOT deleted after the server deletion.
        - `amount_type` - (Required)[string] The type for the given amount. Possible values are: `ABSOLUTE`, `PERCENTAGE`.
        - `termination_policy_type` - (Optional)[string] The type of the termination policy for the autoscaling group so that a specific pattern is followed for Scaling-In replicas. Default termination policy is `OLDEST_SERVER_FIRST`. Possible values are: `OLDEST_SERVER_FIRST`, `NEWEST_SERVER_FIRST`, `RANDOM`
        - `cooldown_period` - (Optional)[string] Minimum time to pass after this Scaling action has started, until the next Scaling action will be started. Additionally, if a Scaling action is currently in progress, no second Scaling action will be started for the same autoscaling group. Instead, the Metric will be re-evaluated after the current Scaling action is completed (either successfully or with failures). This is validated with a minimum value of 2 minutes and a maximum of 24 hours currently. Default value is 5 minutes if not given. *Note that when you set it to values like 5m the API will automatically transform it in PT5M, so the plan will show you a diff in state that should be ignored.*
        - `delete_volumes` - (Required)[bool] If set to `true`, when deleting a replica during scale in, any attached volume will also be deleted. When set to `false`, all volumes remain in the datacenter and must be deleted manually. Note that every scale-out creates new volumes. When they are not deleted, they will eventually use all of your contracts resource limits. At this point, scaling out would not be possible anymore.
    - `scale_in_threshold` - (Required)[int] A lower threshold on the value of `metric`. Will be used with `less than` (<) operator. Exceeding this will start a Scale-In Action as specified by the `scaleInAction` property. The value must have a higher minimum delta to the `scaleOutThreshold` depending on the `metric` to avoid competitive actions at the same time.
    - `scale_out_action` - (Required)[list] Specifies the action to take when the `scaleOutThreshold` is exceeded. Hereby, scaling out is always about adding new VMs to this autoscaling group.
        - `amount` - (Required)[int] When `amountType=ABSOLUTE` specifies the absolute number of VMs that are added. The value must be between 1 to 10. `amountType=PERCENTAGE` specifies the percentage value that is applied to the current number of replicas of the VM Auto Scaling Group. The value must be between 1 to 200. At least one VM is always added.
        - `amount_type` - (Required)[string] The type for the given amount. Possible values are: `ABSOLUTE`, `PERCENTAGE`.
        - `cooldown_period` - (Optional)[string] Minimum time to pass after this Scaling action has started, until the next Scaling action will be started. Additionally, if a Scaling action is currently in progress, no second Scaling action will be started for the same autoscaling group. Instead, the Metric will be re-evaluated after the current Scaling action is completed (either successfully or with failures). This is validated with a minimum value of 2 minutes and a maximum of 24 hours currently. Default value is 5 minutes if not given. *Note that when you set it to values like 5m the API will automatically transform it in PT5M, so the plan will show you a diff in state that should be ignored.*
    - `scale_out_threshold` - (Required)[int] The upper threshold for the value of the `metric`. Used with the `greater than` (>) operator. A scale-out action is triggered when this value is exceeded, specified by the `scaleOutAction` property. The value must have a lower minimum delta to the `scaleInThreshold`, depending on the metric, to avoid competing for actions simultaneously. If `properties.policy.unit=TOTAL`, a value >= 40 must be chosen.

        - `boot_order` - (Optional)[string] Determines whether the volume will be used as a boot volume. Set to NONE, the volume will not be used as boot volume. Set to PRIMARY, the volume will be used as boot volume and set to AUTO will delegate the decision to the provisioning engine to decide whether to use the volume as boot volume.
      Notice that exactly one volume can be set to PRIMARY or all of them set to AUTO.
