## Import

An object storage accesskey resource can be imported using its `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import ionoscloud_object_storage_accesskey.demo objectStorageAccesskeyid
```

This can be helpful when you want to import Object Storage Accesskeys which you have already created manually or using other means, outside of terraform.
