# ionoscloud\_volume

Manages a volume on IonosCloud.

## Example Usage

A primary volume will be created with the server. If there is a need for additional volumes, this resource handles it.

```hcl
resource "ionoscloud_volume" "example" {
  datacenter_id = "${ionoscloud_datacenter.example.id}"
  server_id     = "${ionoscloud_server.example.id}"
  image_name    = "${var.ubuntu}"
  size          = 5
  disk_type     = "HDD"
  ssh_key_path  = "${var.private_key_path}"
  bus           = "VIRTIO"
}
```
